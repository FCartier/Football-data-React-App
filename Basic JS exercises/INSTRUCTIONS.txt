Here you have two short JS exercises:

- Filtering: Given a list of users, store in adultsInfluencers only the ones who have 18 or more years and 2 or more friends.
Then store in sumAge the sum of the age of all the users.
Lastly give them 5 credits if they have 2 or more friends. Store new user list in usersWithCreditsGiven without modifying the original users list.
(tip: try to use a functional programming methods and do it as short as you can)

- Calculate: In this exercise you have to implement a function which can be called and return the expected values.
